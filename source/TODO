TODO list for the Linux port:
  (code fixes only right now - no graphics port work in this file yet.  Is
   anyone working on that yet?)

1.  Fix comparisons between char and unsigned char that gcc warns about.
2.  Fix non virtual destructors for classes
3.  Fix delete[] void warnings
4.  Reformat the code to something a little more readable (use indent maybe?)
5.  Run this through 'gcc -W -Wall' and fix other problems
