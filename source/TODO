TODO list for the Linux port:
  (code fixes only right now - no graphics port work in this file yet.  Is
   anyone working on that yet?)

1.  Get Truecolor graphics to work (title screen for example)
2.  Get JPEG images to work. A modified version of the independant JPEG groups
    library is included, but not used by the Linux version yet.
    
11.  Fix comparisons between char and unsigned char that gcc warns about.
12.  Fix non virtual destructors for classes
13.  Fix delete[] void warnings
14.  Reformat the code to something a little more readable (use indent maybe?)
15.  Run this through 'gcc -W -Wall' and fix other problems
