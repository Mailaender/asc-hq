TODO list for ASC:

1.  Caching of fullscreen image ( file sdl/loadimage.c )
    converting an image from 24 bitt to 8 bit and resizing it is quite slow.
    The image could be cached as PCX with 8 bit and correct resolution to be
    loaded faster the next time.
3.  Clean up the transportcargo routines in mapeditor ( cancel function etc )
5.  Optimize  int VehicleMovement :: getDistance ( int x, int y ) in unitctrl.cpp

11.  Fix comparisons between char and unsigned char that gcc warns about.
13.  Fix delete[] void warnings 
     -> making a class for image data
14.  Reformat the code to something a little more readable (use indent maybe?)
15.  Run this through 'gcc -W -Wall' and fix other problems
