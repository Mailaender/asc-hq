TODO list for ASC:

0.  rewriting tdrawgettempline ( mapalgorithm.cpp )
1.  Caching of fullscreen image ( file sdl/loadimage.c )
    converting an image from 24 bitt to 8 bit and resizing it is quite slow.
    The image could be cached as PCX with 8 bit and correct resolution to be
    loaded faster the next time.
3.  Clean up the transportcargo routines in mapeditor ( cancel function etc )
5.  Optimize  int VehicleMovement :: getDistance ( int x, int y ) in unitctrl.cpp
7.  Replace tterainaccess class by a bitset
9.  Converting getfield()->vehicle == veh to getfield()->unitHere ( veh )
    grep "> *vehicle *==" *.cpp
13.  Fix delete[] void warnings 
     -> making a class for image data
