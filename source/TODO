TODO list for ASC:

Write functions for handling a configuration file. A sample session using the
code could perhaps look like this:
    ConfigurationFile cf ( "~/.asc/asc.rc" );
    int someinteger = cf.getInt ("MouseScrollButton", 2 );   
         // "MouseScrollbutton" is the variable name and 2 the default value 
         // that is returned if the entry (or the whole file) does not exist

    char* somestring = cf.getString("searchpath2", "/var/local/games/asc" );

    // later
    cf.setInt ("MouseScrollbutton", someinteger ); 
    cf.setString("searchpath2", somestring );
    cf.write();

  Some notes: 
    -the configuration should be plain text
    -if comments are allowed (which would be nice), they must of course not be 
        overwritten when writing configuration data
    -Perhaps adding sections to structure the data?
        int someinteger = cf.getInt ("Mouse", "scrollbutton", 2 );   
    -Use plain C / C++ file IO, no ASC specific streams, because they need
        exactly this configuration data to be initialized

1.  Get Truecolor graphics to work (title screen for example)
2.  Get JPEG images to work. A modified version of the independant JPEG groups
    library is included, but not used by the Linux version yet.
3.  Clean up the transportcargo routines in mapeditor ( cancel function etc )
    
11.  Fix comparisons between char and unsigned char that gcc warns about.
13.  Fix delete[] void warnings
14.  Reformat the code to something a little more readable (use indent maybe?)
15.  Run this through 'gcc -W -Wall' and fix other problems
