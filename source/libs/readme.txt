Here are some libraries that are used by ASC:
 bzlib  is used for the DOS, WIN32 and Linux version. Although most Linux 
        systems have this library preinstalled, there are two different and 
        incompatible versions around ( 0.9 and 1.0 ). That's why we 
        principially use the one supplied with ASC.
 triangul  a polygon triangulation library. Used by DOS and Linux version
 getopt Command line parsing routines for platforms that don't supply getopt
        themselfes (windows for example)
