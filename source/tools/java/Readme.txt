This is just a short manual to tell you what these sources and the batch-files are about:

1. Compall.BAT should compile all the JAVA files using javac.exe, so you need it in your path 
   or add the path in the BAT-File!

2. StartSelector.BAT starts the select-dialog where you have to select the DIRECTORY containing your files first
   and then you can choose from the list, the Unit you want to edit. 

Load & Save Routines r working now properly !

If something isn´t working, first check out the ToDo.TXT file, it contains a list, what I still have to
program. So first check and if the problem has nothin to do with items in the list, tell me ! (ASC-Board)   

It's writtin in JAVA so some things could be a little slow, especially starting the applet.

For faster Execution I downloaded the JDK v1.3 and it runs a bit faster.
