Readme for ASC File Editor

--------------------------------

This is just a short text to tell you what these sources and the batch-files are about:

1. Compall.BAT should compile all the JAVA files using javac.exe, so you need it in your path !

2. StartSelector.BAT starts the select-dialog where you have to select the DIRECTORY containing your files first
   and then you can choose from the list the Unit you want to edit. 
   
This is just a test version and you can't save units for the time, but you can check out the editor and tell me
what you think about it and report bugs. (Just use the ASC-Development Board)

Save routines will be activated soon, when they are safe (hehe).

It's writtin in JAVA so some things could be a little slow, especially starting the applet.
