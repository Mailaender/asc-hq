For information about compiling the Linux version of ASC refer to the file 
'INSTALL' 

For information about running the Linux version of ASC refer to 
'doc/readme.linux'.

Information about playing ASC (for example: 'how do mines work?') can be found
in 'doc/asc.html'. That file is totally platform independant and is included
in the seperate data package.

If you want to improve ASC I recommend to read the file 'doc/source.htm'
