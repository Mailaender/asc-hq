FAQ :

THE COMPILE COMPLAINS CAN'T FIND SDL.

./configure --with-SDL-prefix=<where>
<where> should be the prefix you make installed SDL into.

FAQ :

HOW DO I GET SOUND ?!

You will need the following wave files in your current directory when you run
ASC:

Boom.wav
Fail.wav
auto.wav
bomb.wav
cannon.wav
missile.wav

You will then need the following symlinks.

weapon00.wav -> missile.wav
weapon02.wav -> bomb.wav
weapon03.wav -> missile.wav
weapon04.wav -> missile.wav
weapon06.wav -> auto.wav
weapon07.wav -> cannon.wav

I have a bunch of sounds I got from free sound sites on the web which I have
made available to Martin and will be put on http://www.asc-hq.org.


NB: You don't *need* the symlinks pers'e, but they document what each weapon
number means.
