- Change weapon sound timing so that instead of sound then damage bar movement we get:
  1) show full damage bars
  2) play attack sound
  3) change defender damage to show effect
  4) play defence sound
  5) change attacker damage to show effect
  6) pause *briefly*
- Add motor sounds during movement
- Tidy up code so that doxygen produces good output.
