   Description = Comm. Satellite
   Infotext = [The Communications Sattelite is an orbital unit designed to discover
              surface activity. Since the Sattelite is out of range (and even
              out of view) of most enemy units, it is ideally suited to monitor
              enemy operations. Its internal sensor array also allows it to
              spot enemy sattelites.]
