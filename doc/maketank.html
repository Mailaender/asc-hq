This is a description on how to create your own pictures of vehicles. <P>

For a documentation of the different fields that define a vehicle type take a look at the <A HREF="biimport.htm#vehicles">tutorial on importing Battle Isle graphics</A>.<P>


When creating your own graphics the file <TT>tools/hexpics/hexfield.pcx</TT> should be used as the basis and the vehicle has to be painted in the hexagon there. <P>

The colors 16 - 23 (red colortone) will be shifted depending on the player who owns the vehicle. For the second player these colors will be shifted to 24 - 31 and so on. The color #255 is transparent so fill the remaining hexagon with this color when finished.<P>
