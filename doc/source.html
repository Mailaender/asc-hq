<H2>The Source</H2>
</CENTER>
I started writing the program and designed the basic game system in 1994 using Borland Pascal as the programming language. In 1995 I started using object orientated programming and in 1996 I converted the whole project to Watcom C/C++. We started the port to GCC and Linux in 1999. If you look at the source you will "see" this history. If I started such a project now from scratch I would design it completely different (for example a client / server design and everything much more object oriented). But we have the project as it is and are trying to improve it in that direction without rewriting it from scratch.<P>

The source code is not very well structured and documented. I always preferred writing cool new features instead of cleaning up the code :-) <BR>
We are going to improve this gradually. Don't hesitate to <A HREF="contact.html">contact us</A> if you have any questions regarding the source code or anything else about the game.<P>


Another "historical" thing about the source code is the language (not the programming language) that was used for it. Since we did not intend to release the source code we used a mixture of German and English for variable- and function names and avoided writing comments and those that we have are mostly in German. We have now run several translation passes through the code to translate it to English. The global interfaces should be completely in English now, but several local variables may still be in German. Since we run the translation through the code by a source code wide "search and replace" there are now some comments and perhaps a few code elements that were negatively affected by it and sound quite funny.<P>

<H3>Required Tools</H3>

<H4>for building the Windows version</H4>
We are building ASC/win with Borland C++ Builder 5. It should be possible to build ASC with other Windows compilers too, if they have some sufficient understanding of the C++ language. Microsoft Visual C++ has not, at least not the version 5 which I tested. Don't invest any time trying to make ASC compilable with MSVC, I'm not going to restrict my programming to Microsofts subset of C++. Period. There are more capable Win32 compilers around, even some free ones. 

<A HREF="http://www.borland.com">Borland</A> C++ for example. The command line version of compiler and debugger are available for free download. <P>

<OL>
<LI>Get JPEG-lib by the <A HREF="http://www.ijg.org">Independant Jpeg Group</A>.
<LI>Uncompress the JPEG-lib source code into asc/source/libs/jpeg-6b/ . 
<LI>Get SDL 1.2 or newer. It can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org">www.libsdl.org</A>. You need the source code and the DLL file (the later is called: "binary runtime / win32"). 
<LI>Get SDL_mixer 1.2 or newer. It can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html">www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/</A>. You need the source code and the DLL file (the later is called: "binary / win32", get the one without <i>devel</i> in the name). 
<LI>The project files assume there is a <TT>SDL</TT> and a <TT>SDL_mixer</TT> directory located in the same directory where <TT>asc</TT> is placed. You need this directory structure:<BR>  
  <TT>
    asc\<BR>
    asc\source\<BR>
    asc\doc\<BR>
    SDL\<BR>
    SDL\include\<BR>
    SDL\src\<BR>
    SDL_mixer\<BR>
  </TT>
   After uncompressing the SDL and SDL_mixer source packages, move them so that this directory structure forms. You probably have to rename the directories from SDL-1.2 to SDL for example.
<LI>Create a subdirectory called BIN in <TT>SDL\</TT> and put the SDL.DLL into it.
<LI>Go to this directory and run: <TT>IMPLIB -a -c SDL.LIB SDL.DLL</TT> 
<LI>Create a subdirectory called BIN in <TT>SDL_MIXER\</TT> and put the SDL_MIXER.DLL into it.
<LI>Go to this directory and run: <TT>IMPLIB -a -c SDL_mixer.LIB SDL_mixer.DLL</TT>

<TT>SearchPath0=c:\somewhere\</TT><BR>
replace c:\somewhere by the directory where you want ASC to place its files (savegames, etc.).

<H4>for building the Linux version</H4>
Well, nothing special about that. We build ASC with the standard GNU development tools. Refer to INSTALL for (generic) build instructions.

<H4>Watcom C++</H4>

The discontinued DOS version and early Windows versions of ASC were built with Watcom C/C++ 11.0b. Since the compiler is dead and does not support all ANSI-C++ features, ASC can no longer be build with it.
Just in case that the <A HREF="http://www.openwatcom.org">OpenWatcom-Project</A> will bring the compiler up to date, we preserved the <A HREF="source_watcom.html">build instructions</A>.


<H3>Porting ASC</H3>
Porting ASC to any platform supported by SDL should be farely easy (as long as it is 32 bit and has Intel byte order). 

<H3>The source documentation</H3>
The source documentation system used for ASC is <A HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">doxygen</A>. The doxygen configuration file is <TT>asc/source/doxygen.config</TT>.

<H3>A short walk through the ASC source</H3>

THE central class of ASC is <CODE>tmap</CODE> in <TT>gamemap.h</TT>. It is the anchor where nearly all elements of ASC are chained to. The global variable <CODE>actmap</CODE> is a pointer to the active map. There can be a maximum of 8 players on a map, plus neutral units (which are handled like a 9th player). Hence the array of 9 <CODE>Player</CODE> classes inside <CODE>tmap</CODE>. <P>
Each player has units and buildings, which are stored in the lists <CODE>vehicleList</CODE> and <CODE>buildingList</CODE>. The terms units and vehicles are used synonymously in ASC. Since unit was a reserved word in Borland Pascal, we decided to use the term vehicle instead. But now, with ASC written in C++, 'unit' is also used.<P>
Every building and unit is of a certain 'type'. The <CODE>vehicletypes</CODE> and <CODE>buildingtypes</CODE> are stored in the <TT>*.veh</TT> and <TT>*.bld</TT> files, are loaded on startup and globally available. They are not modified during runtime in any way and are referenced by the vehicles and buildings. The <CODE>vehicletype</CODE> has information that are shared by all vehicles of this 'type', like speed, weapon systems, accessable terrain etc, while the <CODE>vehicle</CODE> stores things like remaining movement for this turn, ammo, fuel and cargo.<P>
The <CODE>Vehicle</CODE>, <CODE>Vehicletype</CODE> and <CODE>Buildingtype</CODE> classes are defined in files having the same name as the class, while the <CODE>Building</CODE> class is defined in <TT>building<B>s</B>.h</TT>, since <TT>building.*</TT> was already used for something different. <P>
The primary content of a map are its fields. Each field has again a pointer to a certain weather of a <CODE>terraintype</CODE>. Each terraintype (can currently be found in <TT>typen.h</TT>, but will be moved to its own file sooner of later) has up to 5 different weathers ("dry (standard)","light rain", "heavy rain", "few snow", "lot of snow"). If there is a unit or a building standing on a field, it has a pointer to it. <P>
On the field can be several <CODE>Objects</CODE>. Objects are another central class of ASC. Roads, pipleines, trenches and woods are examples of objects.

<H3>Source code formatting</H3>
Since there are many different source code formatting styles out there, it would be quite a mess if everybody used his own style and spends half his time undoing the formatting that others did. I don't want to force everybody to use exactly the same formatting, but if some source is <B>re</B>formatted, then to a well defined layout.
<A HREF="http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle/">Artistic Style</A> is a capable program for formatting source code.
The settings <TT>--style=linux -s3 -C -S</TT> are recommended to be used for ASC. If you write these settings to a file <TT>~/.astylerc</TT>, you don't need to type them each time you call Astyle. The central setting there is the -s3, which tells Astyle to indent with 3 spaces.<P>

<strong>Some nested and nasty #ifdefs can confuse Astyle. After using Astyle, check the last line of the source file and verify they are correctly indented. If they are not, either fix the #ifdef or restore to the backup file that was created by Astyle!</strong><P>

I personally don't like cutting breaking each line after 80 characters. The times when that was the upper limit of what a monitor could display at once are long passed. And since the first 120 characters (or whatever the size of your screen is) of a command are usually sufficient to get an idea what it is doing, I prefer to not have the next line cluttered with some coordinate calculations that nobody is really interested in.
But, as always, there are exceptions where it helps to break a command into several lines...
<P>
