ASC uses archive files to store many single files in them for easier handling. The term Containerfiles will be used synonyously with archive file. <p>

The primary task of them is to make removing data files possible by a simple update which replaces archive files. 

These Containerfiles can be created with <TT>mount</TT>. To do this, you simply run <TT>MOUNT datafiles [...] containerfile</TT>. The data file names may contain basic wildcards which <TT>Mount</TT> can resolve itself. Containerfile is the name of the archive that is going to be created (or overwritten if it already exists) and should end with <TT>.CON</TT> to be recognized by ASC.<P>

<TT>MOUNT</TT> and <TT>DEMOUNT</TT> are the only ASC tools that do not require any datafiles themself and who do not evaluate any search paths defined in the ASC configuration file.<P>

Example:
<PRE>
mount palette.pal progress.* hexfield.raw data.con
</PRE>
