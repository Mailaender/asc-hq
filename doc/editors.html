<HR>
Not all editors are available for each platform !
<HR>
Important note for DOS and Windows users:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>Make sure you call ALL programs from your game directory, NOT from your TOOLS directory although most editors reside there. <BR>
Type <TT>tools\makeveh</TT> from your game directory to start the hexagonal vehicle editor for example.</b><P>
Under Windows you can create shortcuts for the editors and set the working directory to ASC's main directory. If you don't like neither of the above methods, just move all files from your TOOLS directory to your game directory.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

During the development we never thought about proper names
for everything that is in the game. This was not a problem
until I started writing the documentation, when I realized
that the most appropriate names where already used for other
things. So there is some mess but I hope that it is clear
what I'm trying to say :-)<P>

The game is based upon a number of "categories":<P>
<UL>
<LI>terrain
<LI>units
<LI>buildings
<LI>technologies
<LI>objects
</UL>
<P>
Each category is associated with a certain file extension
and has several items:
<P>


<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
	<TH>category</TH>
	<TH>file extension</TH>
	<TH>examples</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>terrain</TH>
	<TD>*.trr</TD>
	<TD>grassland, coast, water</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>vehicles</TH>
	<TD>*.veh</TD>
	<TD>transport plane, paratrooper, nuclear submarine</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>buildings</TH>
	<TD>*.bld</TD>
	<TD>vehicle factory, research facility, headquarter</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>technologies</TH>
	<TD>*.tec</TD>
	<TD>armor level 2, air cushion vehicles</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TH>objects</TH>
	<TD>*.obl</TD>
	<TD>wood, roads, pipelines</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

Each item is in its own file. All these files are loaded at
startup of the game. So including a new building type is as
simple as putting the appropriate file in the game
directory.<P>
A note for those who want to work with the source code: The classes representing these items are called <CODE>*type</CODE>, like <CODE>Vehicletype</CODE> or <CODE>Buildingtype</CODE> (except for the technologies).
<P>

Each item category has its own editor that is named after the fileextension, for example <TT>MAKEBLD.EXE</TT> is the editor for the buildings.<P>

Documentation for the editors can be found here:<P>
<UL>
<!-- <LI><A HREF="maketrrn.html">terrain editor</A> -->
<LI><A HREF="maketank.html">vehicle editor</A>
<!-- <LI><A HREF="makebuld.html">building editor</A> -->
<LI><A HREF="maketech.html">technology editor</A>
<LI><A HREF="makeobject.html">object editor</A>
</UL>
<P>

Walk throughs that describe the usage of these editors can be found here:
<A HREF="biimport.html">Importing graphics from Battle Isle</A>. Although we no longer use the Battle Isle graphics and the Battle Isle vehicle set has been completely implemented in ASC (but it is not part of the distribution), this text should still be a useful introduction and guide to the editors.<P>

<A NAME="ID"><H3>IDs</H3></A>
The items of every category are identified by an ID that has
to be unique for each category. The assignment of these IDs is the only aspect of ASC that absolutely needs a central management. 

If you are just experimenting, you can use IDs from 100000 to 199999 , but you must never publish ASC items that uses these IDs. 
If you start building some items that you intend to publish, write a short mail to the mailinglist requesting your own set of IDs. There is no shortage of IDs with 2147483647 IDs being available, 
but it must be ensured that each ID is used only once, worldwide.


Here's an example to illustrate the problem:
<blockquote>
Person A builds a unitset UA and uses the IDs 1400 to 1499. These units are published, many maps are created that use these units and many mail games are being played on these maps.
Without knowing that, person B creates their own unit set (lets call it UB) and also uses the IDs 1400  to 1499. As long as B doesn't install UA, there's no problem. Now UB is published, becomes quite successfull and people start playing it by mail.

But nobody will be able to install both UA and UB because of the conflicting IDs. 
And neither person A nor person B will be able to change the IDs of their unitset, because then all existing maps, all running games and all savegames that are using these units will be lost.

So by not coordinating the usage of IDs A and B have made two absolutely incompatible versions of ASC, one that has UA installed and one that has UB installed.

</blockquote>

So if you build some ASC items and there is the slightest chance that these items will leave you PC (for example because you want to play against a friend using these items), please obtain your own unique set of IDs.

<P>

<H3>Some hints</H3>

The Editors (<TT>MAKE*.EXE</TT>) ask for the values of the properties
one after another. With the key combinations <TT>&lt;Ctrl-C&gt;</TT> or
<TT>&lt;Ctrl break&gt;</TT> they can be exited at any time if you entered
wrong values and don't want them to be saved.
Besides the first questions (make/load; picture; continue)
the values can always be confirmed with <TT>&lt;Enter&gt;</TT> when editing
an existing item. If for example only the first property
shall be changed all further parameters can be confirmed
simply by holding <TT>&lt;Enter&gt;</TT>.
This does not seem to be correct on first sight for the
classes of vehicle types but it really is.


<P>
The editor package contains additionally:<P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="mapedit.html"><TT>EDHEX.EXE</TT></A> map editor,  which has recently been moved to the main package. 

<LI><A HREF="prnttank.html"><TT>PRNTVEH.EXE</TT></A> generates text files with list the parameters of the vehicle types.

<LI><A HREF="mount.html"><TT>MOUNT.EXE</TT></A> builds container files.

<LI><A HREF="demount.html"><TT>DEMOUNT.EXE</TT></A> extracts container files.

<!-- <LI><A HREF="clearup.html"><TT>CLEARUP.EXE</TT></A> deletes unused files of older small updates after a  complete update. You should only use it when the use of it is stated as necessary in the documentation of an update for the game.<P>
