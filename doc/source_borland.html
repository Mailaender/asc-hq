Detailed instructions for setting up the required libraries:

<OL>
<LI>Get the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/jpegsr6.zip">JPEG-lib source code</A> by the <A HREF="http://www.ijg.org">Independant Jpeg Group</A>.
<LI>Uncompress the JPEG-lib source code into asc/source/libs/jpeg-6b/ (this directory already exists). 
<LI>Get SDL 1.2 or newer. It can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org">www.libsdl.org</A>. You need the source code and the DLL file (the later is called: "binary runtime / win32"). 
<LI>Get SDL_mixer 1.2 or newer. It can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/index.html">www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/</A>. You need the source code and the DLL file (the later is called: "binary / win32", get the one without <i>devel</i> in the name). 
<LI>Get SDL_image 1.2 or newer. It can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html">www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/</A>. You need the source code and the DLL file (the later is called: "binary / win32", get the one without <i>devel</i> in the name). 
<LI>Get SDLmm. It can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://sdlmm.sourceforge.net">sdlmm.sourceforge.net</A>. You only need the source code. 
<LI>The project files assume there is a <TT>SDL</TT>, <TT>SDL_mixer</TT>, <TT>SDL_image</TT>  and a <TT>SDLmm</TT> directory located in the same directory where <TT>asc</TT> is placed. You need this directory structure:<BR>  
  <TT>
    asc\  <i>(from ASC source package or CVS)</i><BR>
    asc\source\<BR>
    asc\doc\<BR>
    SDL\  <i>(from SDL source package)</i> <BR>
    SDL\include\<BR>
    SDL\src\<BR>
    SDL_mixer\   <i>(from SDL_mixes source package)</i><BR>
    SDLmm\   <BR>
    SDL_image\   <BR>
  </TT>
   After uncompressing the packages, move them so that this directory structure forms. You probably have to rename the directories from SDL-1.2 to SDL, for example. <BR>
   The asc directory may be called differently. If you downloaded the asc source package from the homepage, that is no problem, it may for example be named asc-1.5.0 
<LI>Create a subdirectory called BIN in <TT>SDL\</TT> and put the SDL.DLL into it.
<LI>Go to this directory and run: <TT>IMPLIB -a -c SDL.LIB SDL.DLL</TT> 
<LI>Create a subdirectory called BIN in <TT>SDL_MIXER\</TT> and put the SDL_MIXER.DLL into it.
<LI>Go to this directory and run: <TT>IMPLIB -a -c SDL_mixer.LIB SDL_mixer.DLL</TT> 
<LI>Create a subdirectory called BIN in <TT>SDL_IMAGE\</TT> and put all DLLs from the SDL_image binary backage into it.
<LI>Go to this directory and run for each DLL: <TT>IMPLIB -a -c dllname.LIB dllname.DLL</TT> 

<H6>Borland C++ Builder</H6>
<OL start=10>
<LI>Open <TT>asc/Asc.bpg</TT> and run "make all projects"
<LI>If you want to run ASC from within Borland C++ Builder, place a file <TT>ASC.INI</TT> in <TT>asc\soure\win32\borland\</TT> that contains the following line: <BR>
<TT>SearchPath0=c:\somewhere\</TT><BR>
replace c:\somewhere by the directory where you want ASC to place its files (savegames, etc.). 
<LI>Get the datafile (main.con) from the <A HREF="http://www.asc-hq.org/download.html">website</A> and put it in this directory.
</OL>
<H6>Free Borland C++ command line compiler</H6>
<OL start=10>
<LI>Execute <TT>asc/makebcc.bat</TT> <P>

All major files will be placed in the <TT>asc\game\</TT> directory that is going to be created.
